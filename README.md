I will make a longer video when I have ironed out some problems!

# How To Use 
When you first clone this code to your machine you will need to install inquirer, Mysql2, and console.table packages. When you are finsihed downloading those things you will open up your terminal and type in Node server.js. You will then be ready to start organizing your employees.
